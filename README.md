<b>Epesi BIM</b> (Business Information Manager) is a fully functional web CRM application to store, organize, access and share business records. Manage your data precisely, flexibly and easily, simplifying internal communication and making work-flow more efficient. It runs on any xAMP stack on all operating systems including Raspberry Pi. It is small, fast and can easily handle millions of records and hundreds of users.

Epesi has modular architecture and provides a great starting point for a full blown ERP system. You can use it as a <b>kickstarter</b> for your project as it already includes:

- Dashboard
- Admin Panel
- User Management
- Advanced CRUD engine
- CRM functionality
- Advanced Epesi File Storage
- Advanced Permissions system
- Unlimited users license
- and more...

As a developer you can control which files are installed by default using simple <i>distro.ini</i> file, where you specify which modules should be setup on the first try. This way you can create your own Epesi distro and complete web application, which can be very easily deployed in the cloud.

<b>About</b>

EPESI BIM is a result of many years of experience working with SMB businesses and addresses inefficiencies of current e-mail “collaboration” workflow and commonplace data management using inadequate spreadsheet applications. It is a completely web based application designed for small and medium-sized enterprises trying to optimize business processes, simplify office work and reduce administrative costs. It does not require any client to be installed - any modern browser on any operating system will work - drastically reducing the deployment cost.

Our software can make your organization more efficient, better organized and more competitive. We can help you simplify and automate internal procedures with management of important business information.

- To eliminate e-mail in our workplace we internally use <b>EPESI</b> for all tasks, notes, projects and tickets - making our life more organized. 
- In addition we use great multiplatform and programmable chat: <b>Telegram https://telegram.org/</b> available here at Github as well: https://github.com/telegramdesktop

Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free. You can use Telegram on all your devices at the same time — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.

- Epesi is already integrated with Telegram messaging platform te receive notifications from the <b>Watchdog</b> module (free and included with the latest release) as well as with Time tracking and reporting module integrated with Premium module Timesheets.
